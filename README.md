## General Information
- I am a data analyst with a focus on Fraud Risk.
- I enjoy learning and applying various Machine Learning techniques, especially to the area of imbalanced classification (this is common in the area of Fraud Risk).
- I also enjoy building various apps related to visualizations and data analytics.
